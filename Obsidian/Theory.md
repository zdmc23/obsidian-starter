## Organization

|  | Used? | For | Why? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Folders | ‚úÖ | organizing lots of similar files (as flatly nested as possible) | to make file-based access more practical, and to *hide* some Notes (ie, `/Media`, `/Daily`) |
| Links | ‚úÖ | linking from `/Daily` and MOCs üó∫Ô∏è , and quick create | all the benefits of obsidian: Graph view (red indicator of being uncreated), backlinks, etc... |
| Metadata | ‚ùå | adding kv properties data (for later search/retrieval) | the metadata that I want (ie, filename, created_date) is already accessible via `dataview` |
| Tags | ‚úÖ | hierarchical categorization (ie, #christian/living/prayer) | easily organize and quickly find related by hierarchy of categories (via search and tag viewer/wrangler). also useful when combined w/ `dataview` |

## Workflow

### Daily Notes

- `/Daily` Notes to capture *Fleeting Notes*, and then `Tag` them, and create initial `Links` for *Literature Notes* when appropriate (or come back and create after later `Review`).  This allows for a historical log of what was being discovering/investigating at that particular moment in time (which is another important lens)

### MOCs üó∫Ô∏è (Maps of Content)

#### Visual (Canvas)

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgT4URhnvT8 *(6:40 length)*
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItdCkNksL78 *(15:20 length)*
- `DataView` Notes are previewed on Canvas (think Dashboard-like capes)
- Embeds  (ie, YouTube) are previewed on Canvas

#### Traditional (File)

- [[000 Home üó∫Ô∏è]]

### Zettelkasten Lite

- Fleeting Notes (Daily Notes)
- Literature, Reference, Permanent Notes -> Literature Notes (Obsidian Files)
- Index, Zettel Notes -> MOCs üó∫Ô∏è

### Flashcards

- For learning and reinforcing important content
- Spaced-Repetition approach (https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition)

### Review

- Periodic review of Daily Notes for the purpose of creating Literature Notes and Flashcards

### Special Cases

#### Same Name Notes

##### Same Folder

Resist the temptation to nest Folders too often. Instead rename the Notes hierarchically:
- `LLM Providers`
- `RAG Providers`
##### Different Folder

What to do when you have a Note with the same name but is located under different Folders? eg., `LLM/Memory` vs. `Nualua/Memory`

Retain shallow Folder nesting, but visually distinguish in the Link (according to the following format):
- `LLM/Memory|LLM/Memory`
- `Nualua/Memory|Nualua/Memory`
